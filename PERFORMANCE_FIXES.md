# Performance Fixes for Quantum Forge

## Problem

The page was freezing due to multiple performance issues:

- Multiple setInterval loops running every 5 seconds
- Heavy 3D rendering in office visualizer
- Excessive real-time updates
- Large CSS file with many animations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Performance Manager Service (`js/services/performance-manager.js`)

- Centralized interval management
- Automatic low-power mode detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- Auto-stopping intervals after max updates

### 2. Performance Monitor Service (`js/services/performance-monitor.js`)

- Real-time FPS monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Long task detection
- Emergency mode for freezing prevention

### 3. Optimized Component Updates

- **Analytics Service**: Reduced update frequency from 5s to 10s
- **Real-time Stats**: Updates every 15s instead of 5s
- **Office Visualizer**: Updates every 20s instead of 5s
- **App.js**: Staggered component initialization

### 4. CSS Performance Optimizations

- Reduced animation complexity for low-end devices
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- Optimized for mobile devices

### 5. Emergency Mode

- Automatically detects performance issues
- Stops all intervals when freezing detected
- Shows user notification
- Reduces animation complexity

## How to Use

### For Users

1. The page will automatically optimize itself
2. If freezing occurs, emergency mode will activate
3. Performance warnings will appear if needed
4. All optimizations are automatic

### For Developers

```javascript
// Check performance stats
window.performanceManager.getPerformanceStats();

// Check performance metrics
window.performanceMonitor.getMetrics();

// Manually stop all intervals
window.performanceManager.clearAllIntervals();

// Enable/disable low power mode
window.performanceManager.enableLowPowerMode();
window.performanceManager.disableLowPowerMode();
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before

- Multiple 5-second intervals running simultaneously
- Heavy 3D rendering without optimization
- No performance monitoring
- No emergency mode

### After

- Centralized interval management
- Reduced update frequencies
- Automatic performance monitoring
- Emergency mode for freezing prevention
- Staggered component loading
- Mobile-optimized CSS

## Monitoring

The system now includes:

- FPS monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Long task detection
- Automatic optimization
- User notifications

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-optimized performance
- Accessibility compliance

## Testing

To test the performance fixes:

1. Open the page
2. Check browser console for performance logs
3. Monitor for any freezing issues
4. Test on different devices and browsers

The page should now load smoothly without freezing issues.
