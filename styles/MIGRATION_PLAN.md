# Component System Migration Plan

## Current Status
- Existing component system is stable and working
- New component system (v2) is being introduced gradually
- Both systems coexist during migration

## Migration Steps

### Phase 1: Introduction (Current)
- New component system added alongside existing
- No breaking changes
- Components-v2 extends rather than replaces

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Add new features through components-v2
- Test each enhancement thoroughly
- Keep existing styles as fallback

### Phase 3: Gradual Adoption
- Move components one at a time
- Test each migration thoroughly
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Phase 4: Cleanup
- Remove duplicate styles
- Consolidate variables
- Clean up dependencies

## Critical Dependencies
- critical.css (Core variables)
- theme-system.css (Theme functionality)
- components.css (Base components)
- unified-homepage-styling.css (Homepage overrides)
- final-background-fix.css (Critical fixes)
