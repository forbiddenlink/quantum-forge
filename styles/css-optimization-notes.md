### Key Design Elements Applied

- **Background Gradient**: `linear-gradient(135deg, #6366f1 0%, #4338ca 100%)` with additional animated layers
- **Glassmorphism Cards**: `background: linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15) 0%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08) 100%)`

### Performance Optimizations

- GPU acceleration with `will-change` and `transform: translateZ(0)`
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Mobile-optimized animations
- Loading state animations

### Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **CSS File Consolidation**: Could combine some smaller CSS files
